# Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Binding and Trapping of Malodor Molecules in PET Fibers


## Introduction

This project was performed by University of Delaware students, Nikhil Karthikeyan (NK), Kelsey Koutsoukos (KK) and Wanwei Pan (WP) in collaboration with IFF corporation. Malodor molecules represent unpleasant odorous compounds originating from the by-products of bacterial metabolism and accumulation of sweat, sebum and other bodily secretions. It has been noted in past literature that these molecules stick to synthetic fibers more than natural fibers such as cotton by [Munk et al. 2001](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11743-001-0192-2). The goal of the project is to identify the bonding mechanisms and structural evolution of three malodour molecule species, Methyl Butanoic Acid (MBA), Ethyl Butanoic Acid (ETB) and Z-4-Heptenal (HEP) on PolyEthylene Teraphthalate (PET). The distribution of work among the group at UD is shown below and follows the standard set by [NISO](https://credit.niso.org/).

## Data provenance

Three configurations of malodour molecule and PET fiber systems were constructed and simulated in an anhydrous and hydrated state. Three analysis techniques were used to calculate the desired properties and those were the radial distribution function (RDF), cluster size, and binding energy calculated using the Linear Interaction Energy technique (LIE). 

### Single chain with single molecules around it

Configuration 1 is defined as a single PET chain with 50 repeat units placed in the middle of a simulation box, followed by placing 1 copy of each malodour molecule 1.5nm from the PET chain, 5nm from each subsequent malodour molecule. This allowed us to determine a general idea of the interaction strengths and trends of the malodour molecules and how the presence of water affected these properties. This data is located in the directory titled `single_chain-single_molecule` with anhydrous and hydrated states named accordingly in the directory. All directories are listed for runs in the table below.

| Hydration  | run1  | run2  | run3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anhydrous | `single_chain-single_molecule/anhydrous/run1`  | `single_chain-single_molecule/anhydrous/run2`  | `single_chain-single_molecule/anhydrous/run2`  |
| Hydrated  | `single_chain-single_molecule/hydrated/run1`   | `single_chain-single_molecule/hydrated/run1`   | `single_chain-single_molecule/hydrated/run1`   |

### Single chain with a droplet on it

Configuration 2 is defined as a single PET chain with 50 repeat units placed in the middle of a simulation box, followed by placing 300 malodour molecules in a droplet of radius 2nm at the center of the chain. This experiment was performed separately for each malodour molecule so as to quantitatively determine the interaction strengths, cluster behavior and bonding interactions underpinning the observed behaviour. This data is located in the directory titled `single_chain-droplet` with anhydrous and hydrated states named accordingly in the directory. All directories are listed for runs in the table below for each malodour molecule

### Single fibril with three droplets on it

Configuration 3 is defined as a single PET fibril placed in the middle of a simulation box, followed by placing three droplets of 150 malodour molecules each in a droplet of radius 1.5nm with each droplet spaced 20nm apart. One PET fibril is constructed of 4 PET chains of 50 repeat units placed 0.4nm from each other, with benzene rings facing each other. This allowed us to determine a general idea of the interaction strengths and trends of the malodour molecules and how the presence of water affected these properties. This data is located in the directory titled `square_fibril_droplets` with anhydrous and hydrated states named accordingly in the directory.
