    "I used `O=C(O)c1cccc(C(=O)CCO)c1`, a smiles string of the PET monomer in ligpargen to create the opls-AA representation of the PET monomer. I then corrected the opls_aa type assignments. Note for each generated molecule, the structure will be different. Thus care needs to be taken when generalizing these results for all PET's generated in ligpargen. The results and FF modifications only work for this molecule"

I then tried to run the `pdb2gmx` generated topology file with gromacs which failed during the energy minimization step. This was due to some of the angles and dihedrals not having default values. This was solved by adding the default values using the atomnames from `ffnonbonded.itp` into `ffbonded.itp`. I added these by looking at the line that was causing an issue in `topology.top` and adding the corresponding bond names and default values from `PET.itp` obtained from ligpargen to the appropriate columns in `ffnonbonded.itp`. After conversion, the topol.top still says other instead of PET. "
