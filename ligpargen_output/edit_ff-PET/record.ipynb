    "I used `O=C(O)c1cccc(C(=O)CCO)c1`, a smiles string of the PET monomer in ligpargen to create the opls-AA representation of the PET monomer. I then corrected the opls_aa type assignments. Note for each generated molecule, the structure will be different. Thus care needs to be taken when generalizing these results for all PET's generated in ligpargen. The results and FF modifications only work for this molecule"
